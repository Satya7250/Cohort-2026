# Mintlify Landing Page Clone

This project is a static recreation of the [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) landing page. It showcases a modern, dark-themed design focused on documentation platforms for the intelligence age.

## Project Overview

The landing page features:
- **Hero Section**: A compelling introduction with a call-to-action for users to sign up.
- **Brand Showcase**: A grid of logos displaying companies that use or support the platform (e.g., Anthropic, Coinbase, Microsoft).
- **Feature Highlights**: Sections explaining the core value propositions, such as "Built for the intelligence age" and support for LLMs.
- **Responsive Navigation**: A top navigation bar with links to Resources, Documentation, Pricing, etc.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structure and semantic markup.
